The detailed license risk can be used for 2-layer configurations: 
- Project: in the sense of a software artifact including other software artifacts (OSS or not)
- OSS Component: OSS software components included in Projects

You can use these models following these steps:
1) Upload the three models in RISCOSS.
2) Create a risk configuration. E. g. you can create a risk configuration called 'License Risks'.
4) Assign license_indicators.xml to layer OSS Component. The other two should be assigned to layer Project.

Thats all. Now you can create several entities of type _OSS Component_; create at least one of type _Project_, containing one or more of the _OSS Component_ you have defined. Then, you will be able to create a Multi-layer analysis sessions choosing an entity of type _Project_ you have created to the risk configuration you also created previously _License Risks_.
